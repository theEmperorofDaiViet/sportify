# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
Before cloning and using this application, you'll need to install these things on your computer:
* [Java SE Development Kit 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17): Of course you need to have Java installed to run a Java application. I used Java 17, but I think it works fine with the widely-used Java 8 (JDK 1.8), as well.
* [Apache NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/): a free, open source, integrated development environment (IDE) that enables you to develop desktop, mobile and web applications. The IDE supports application development in various languages, including Java, HTML5, PHP and C++. The IDE provides integrated support for the complete development cycle, from project creation through debugging, profiling and deployment. The IDE runs on Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, and other UNIX-based systems.
* [Apache Tomcat 8.5](https://tomcat.apache.org/): an open-source Java servlet container that implements many Java Enterprise Specs such as the Websites API, Java-Server Pages and last but not least, the Java Servlet.
* [MySQL 8.0](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/): an open source relational database management system that was originally released in 1995. MySQL is popular among all databases, and is ranked as the 2nd most popular database, only slightly trailing Oracle Database. Among open source databases, MySQL is the most popular database in use today and known as one of the most reliable and performative databases out there.

## Installation
You can install this application by cloning this repository into your current working directory:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/theEmperorofDaiViet/sportify.git
```
After cloning the repository, you can open the project by NetBeans.

Add necessary libraries to the project by right-clicking on the Libraries folder, select the Add JAR/Folder command, and navigate to [/web/lib](/web/lib), then select all jar files inside it. I stored all the libraries needed for the project in this folder.

> :pushpin: **If you are using JPA Version**: You also need to add a JPA library to the project: Right-click on the project's Libraries folder, select the Add Library command, and select the EclipseLink library in the resulting dialog box.

Open the context.xml file in [/web/META-INF](/web/META-INF) to change the information about the datasource to fit your own settings.

Open MySQL and create two databases according to the script in script.sql file in [/](/).

Back to NetBeans and run the application. If this is the first time you use Tomcat, NetBeans may display a dialog asking you to choose a web server for the application. Click "Add" and refer to the directory where Tomcat installed.

Finally, if NetBeans asks for Tomcat authentication, open the tomcat-users.xml file in the [/conf](/) folder under the Tomcat directory to see the username and password. You can change them if you want.

After that, the application will run on port 8080 by default. A new tab in your browser will be opened automatically, showing the home page of the application, or at least I hope so...

## 2. End Users:
- Verify the user by cookies:
  - If the user has already registered, he/she can listen and download songs, place an order for physical albums.
  - Otherwise, the application forward to a register page, but different from the one in home page: if the user enter an existing email address, the application consider it as an update to the existing one, and use it as the user of the current session - instead of forcing the user to enter a different email address.

- Process Invoices: view a list of unprocessed invoices, view the details of any unprocessed invoice and process the invoice.
- Display Reports: 2 types of report:
  - User Email Report: the application downloads an .xls file for the report. You can open that file using Microsoft Excel.
